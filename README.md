# Turf App

A modern web application for managing and tracking turf-related activities.

## Features

- Modern UI with Tailwind CSS
- Type-safe development with TypeScript
- Real-time analytics and performance monitoring
- Error boundary handling
- Responsive design
- Dark mode support

## Environment Configuration

### Important: Do Not Delete .env.local

The `.env.local` file contains critical configuration for the application, including:
- Domain settings for authentication
- OAuth provider configurations
- API keys and secrets

If this file is deleted, authentication will break because:
1. OAuth redirects will fail
2. Session cookies won't work properly
3. API calls will fail

### Setting Up Environment Variables

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

2. Update the values in `.env.local` with your actual configuration:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`: Must be `https://app.turfyeah.com`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`: Must be `https://app.turfyeah.com`
   - `AUTH_REDIRECT_URL`: Must be `https://app.turfyeah.com/api/auth/callback`

### Domain Configuration

The application uses `app.turfyeah.com` as its primary domain. Any requests to `app.turfeah.com` will be automatically redirected to the correct domain.
